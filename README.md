# Netflix-DataSet
This project is a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Netflix Movies and TV Shows, using Python and powerful data science libraries. It involves data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insight extraction — all implemented in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

📂 Data Source
The dataset contains 8,800+ Netflix titles including Movies and TV Shows, with attributes like title, type, country, release year, rating, genre, and date added to the platform.

🧼 Data Cleaning

Removed duplicate records

Filled or removed missing values where necessary

Converted date columns to datetime format

Stripped white spaces and standardized text entries

🔍 Data Exploration

Identified the proportion of Movies vs TV Shows

Analyzed the top countries producing Netflix content

Explored the most common genres and ratings

Investigated the number of titles added each year

📊 Visualizations
Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create:

Bar plots for content types and genre frequency

Line plots for year-wise additions

Histograms and count plots for content ratings

Pie charts for country contributions
